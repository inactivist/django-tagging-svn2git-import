==============
Django Tagging
==============

This is a generic tagging application for Django projects

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.

## NOTE ##
This is a clone of the [original Google code repo][original] since
the original appears to be dead (unmaintained) with many [open
issues].  The goal is to provide a venue for ongoing development if
the community so desires.

### TODO ###
I want to try to migrate issues from Google code to this repo using
[googlecode2github]'s [shadowissues.py] utility.
